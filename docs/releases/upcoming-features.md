### Completed

??? success "V19.0"
	**TCP network overlay**

	|Release  | V19 Solidus|
	|---------|------------|
	|Goal     | Provide support for live traffic over TCP, keeping UDP as a fallback mechanism.|
	|Benefits | Decrease amount of traffic and connections nodes need to maintain and reduce resource usage and increase higher peak TPS capabilities|

### Recent Page Updates

**2019-07-30**

* Moved Local account priority bootstrapping item into Research section with unknown feature target. Updates related to this are targeted for V20: better prioritization of bootstrap accounts using a pre-calculated list of high depth accounts packaged with the node release 

??? info "Other past changes"

	**2019-07-11**

	* Moved V19 items into new Completed section
	* Moved targeted V20 items into In Progress section

	**2019-07-05**

	* Confirmed-only bootstrapping removed from list - the complexity and effort level of this feature for the provided benefits didn't align to implement on its own at this time. Situations that may warrant such a change, including long strings of forked blocks, will be monitored on the network and if seen, this feature will be reevaluated for inclusion in the future.

	**2019-06-11**

	* Protobuf based RPCs target moved from V20 to V21
	* RPC 2.0 target moved from V20 to V21
